# AI ML Resources from My Diary   
   
This is my personal diary which contains resources, which I know, learned or people have told me
to experiment with. I started writing this diary in Mar’ 2019. This diary is related to my work/learning
in data science, AI, ML, NLP, DL, GNN, GAN, Statistics, etc. A few links related to Software
Development, People Management, Project Management are also kept in this diary. The resources
here are python/R library link, blog articles, YouTube video links, article links, AI products links,
architecture, images etc. The Table of Content and Content of this diary is not any specific order.
Whatever I was/am getting I keep adding into this, mostly towards the end but not always.

**This is a 390 page personal learning diary and it contains approx 1000 resources. List of the resources available in this file are mentioned below. This diary is written between Mar-19 to Dec-22.**

## Data Science Notes/Screenshot

Henrik Ibsen famously coined the phrase 'A picture is worth a thousand words,' a sentiment that rings particularly true in the realm of learning, especially within the dynamic field of data science. Throughout my learning journey, I've diligently amassed a collection of data science, AI, ML, and MLOps-related visuals from diverse sources such as presentations, books, and YouTube channels. While some of these images are copyrighted, caution is advised when utilizing them; it's advisable to refrain from direct copying. If any particular image catches your interest, consider reaching out to the original author for permission. Tools like Google Image or Google Lens can assist in identifying and acknowledging the image's copyright holders. As of December '23, my Dropbox holds an extensive library of over 1100+ images, continually updated. During moments of leisure when you prefer visual learning through flowcharts, images, and the exploration of shapes and colors, feel free to explore this [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/a8hq2rmzabjkc9x85ctf8/h?rlkey=h5c3j741fsbdr8eqtko6klwbp&dl=0)
