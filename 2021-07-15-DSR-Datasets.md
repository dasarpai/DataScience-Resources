# 150+ Machine Learning Datasets   
   
## Introduction:   
   
Without Data there is no Machine Learning, no AI, no Deep Learning. Because of heavy automation, IOT devices all around, there is no dirth of data. The first issue is, due to privacy and security related issues, data is not available for everyone. The second issue is cleaning this data. He third issues is getting complete data which can solve a given business problem. To get the complete data you need to get the data from multiple sources, identify the key to connect different records/sample of different sources. It is an expensive and time-consuming step of data science project. If you want to learn data science or want to solve any existing problem using new methods. Then you need some benchmarking framework in place which can display the model metrics (recall/precision/accuracy etc.) of each new approach (algorithm) against a given dataset. So datasets play a critical role in benchmarking algorithm performance.


Thus, machine learning rely heavily on high-quality datasets for training and evaluation. These datasets serve as the foundation for developing robust and accurate models across various AI domains, including classical machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), audio processing, and time series analysis. Access to diverse and comprehensive datasets is crucial for researchers and practitioners to tackle real-world problems and advance the field of machine learning.


In this article, I am publishing a curated collection of datasets sourced from over 150 data sources. These datasets and data sources have been carefully selected to cover a wide range of domains, ensuring their relevance to different machine learning applications. Whether you are working on a NLP/text project, CV/image project, audio project, or time series forecasting, or classical machine learning, you'll find valuable datasets to support your research and development efforts. Let's dive into the world of machine learning datasets and discover the wealth of resources available to fuel your projects. If you dig each link, you will find hundreds, if not thousands of datasets under many of the links shared. I hope you will get benefitted from this work. 

**Note:** These links I got from chrome bookmarks. At the time of writing this article, I have validated the link. If you find any link is not work / wrongly pointing / wrongly describing then please help me in improving this article. You can write to me at hari.prasad @ vedavit-ps .com.
