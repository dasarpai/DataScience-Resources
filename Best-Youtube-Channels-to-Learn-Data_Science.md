Education. People who want to enter the field do not know where to start. They wonder whether they need a PhD, or perhaps a few years in a remotely related job. Universities have been slow at adapting their educational offering. In fact, a specialized data science training program is not even offered on most campuses, and when it is, the prerequisites of statistical and mathematical knowledge can be intimidating. All this results in an environment where companies struggle to find well-prepared candidates who have acquired the necessary expertise and are ready to start their data science career. This is how 365 Data Science started. We are a group of friends turned start-up enthusiasts. Our journey began in 2016 with the mission to create the world’s most accessible and intuitive data science training materials.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gramener" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gramener</a></td><td>185</td><td>0.8K</td><td>Gramener is a design-led data science and storytelling company that solves complex business problems with compelling data stories using insights and a low-code analytics platform, Gramex.
